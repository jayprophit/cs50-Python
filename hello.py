# Sinlgle Line Comment - 'number sign, hash, or pound sign' (#) is a comment, which allows you to leave notes that are reminders that are ignored by the programme

'''
Paragraph Commnet
 Three apostrophe's 'punctuation marks' (''' ''') or three Quotation marks (""" """) before and after your text, 
 allows comment of a section of information, 
 to leave notes that are reminders that are ignored by the programme

'''
Python is a program otherwise known as an interperator.  
It converts the file into readable binary code a computer can understand,
then it changes the programme into readable human language
'''

'''
Create New File
Using the terminal and typing 
code name.py
in the place of name, is where you put your file name
this allows you to create a new file
'''

'''
Run/ Exicute Python Code
Using the terminal and typing
python name.py
in the place of name, is where you put your file name
this will run your programme
'''

'''
Functions
a function is like an action or a verb,
that lets you do something in the programme.
generally any language comes with some predetermined set of functions.
the can be very basic actions or verbs, 
that the language will already know how to use.
as a programmer you can use the functions to get the computer to do those things

some functions take multiple arguments, 
if you seperate the arguments to the function with a comma, 
you can pass in 1 or more arguments

e.g.

print("hello", + name)
print("hello, ", )

when you pass multiple arguments to print,
it automatically inserts a space for you
'''

'''
Arguements
is an input to a function that somehow influences its's behavior 
'''

'''
print()
Print is a function that use's parentheses, 
as an ability to take in some input of string of text data, 
in english or any other human language.
that you want this function to print onto the screen
'''

'''
speech text that is visible and reable to the user is placed inside comma's ('text') or quotation marks ("text"),
as python accepts both,
just remember to keep consistant when using a specific se when coding, 
as to not break code or confuse your self or some one else who may need to eidt the code in the future
'''

'''
Side Effects
when a function is exicuterd. 
The program gives back an action from the commands given.
it can be:-

visual
audio
'''

'''
Bugs
are mistakes that coders and progammers make, 
that causes errors in the programme
and its the coders and progammers job to fix theses problems
before, during and after programme launch.
Theses are just seen as problems that need to be solved, edited, rewritten, modified or simplified
'''

'''
Retrun values
a feature of some of one or more funtions, 
that returns values.

output = return value
e.g.

# question = what's your name?
input = what's your name?

# answer = John
output = John
'''

'''
Variables
can store a value of some number, text, image, video or more.
a variable is a container for some value, 
inside of a computer or inside a programme that can be used or reused at any time
'''

'''
input()
exspects what's called a string, 
it's exspecting text which is going to prompt the user
'''

'''
= sign means assignment operator
this means the programmer wants to asign from right to left

e.g.

name = input("What's your name? ")

the "input("what's your name? ")" is now stored in the word "name"
meaning any time the word name is called upon as a function,
it will display:-

what's your name?
'''

'''
Concatenation
to join the thing on the left and the thing on the right

e.g.

("hello + world")
'''

'''
String - (str)
a sequence of text be it english or any other human language, 
this is classed as data in programmes
